A web-based simulation lab that enables a virtual learning experience in this system. 

This virtual lab is centred on the Computer Graphics (CG) and Operating System (OS) topics, with the line drawing algorithms, Circle drawing algorithm, CPU Scheduling method, disc scheduling algorithm, and page replacement algorithm receiving special attention. In computer visual systems, the straight line is the simplest fundamental function. The Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA), Bresenham line drawing algorithm, Bresenham circle drawing algorithm, First Come First Serve (FCFS) CPU Scheduling algorithm, First In First Out (FIFO) Page Replacement algorithm, and SCAN disk scheduling algorithm all have simulators in this lab. 

Languages like Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), and JavaScript are utilized to create this system, together with the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE) as a code editor and TurboC for graph generation. We want to attain both theoretical and practical perception by using this virtual platform.
